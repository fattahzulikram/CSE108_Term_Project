# CSE108_Term_Project
Term project for CSE108 in level 1 term 2. It was a collaboration between me & A. Z. M Mehedi Hasan.

Clash Royale - Or maybe a rip-off, I should say. The purpose of this project was the multithreading and networking, so the UI is not even close to the real deal.
Some of the features of this project are - player login, player account, player trophy, overall leaderboard & active player list. The gameplay is similar to original Clash Royale, but there is no deck creation or anything, a fixed amount of card for all.

This project is written in Java & it uses JavaFX. Maximum images & sounds that are used here are not mine. They are taken from the internet, all credits to them.
